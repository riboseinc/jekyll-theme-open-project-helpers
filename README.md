Jekyll plugin for the Open Project gem-based Jekyll theme by Ribose.

It provides the data reading and page generation capabilities
required by the theme.

Currently it enables such features as tag-based filtering
of open software and specification indexes, unified blog index,
fetching open project/software/specification data from their repos.

## Releasing

### New approach

Do `git tag ${version-tag}` or, start release manually with the
[`release.yml` workflow](https://github.com/riboseinc/jekyll-theme-open-project-helpers/actions/workflows/release.yml)
